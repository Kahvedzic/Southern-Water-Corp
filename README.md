The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) is responsible for looking after the United States of America's domestic energy network. The regulators responsibilty is to ensure that America's energy netowork remains reliable with minimal disruptions, which are known as outages. There are four key types of outages:
Consequential - This outage is caused by an exogenous event or consequence of work unrealted to the energy provider(i.e A transmission line may be down, which means that a particular power provider may be unable. Â to send energy to the network)
Forced - This outage is caused by a situation that has forced the power generating asset to be unavailble. Â In other words, it has caught the AEMR by suprise and was not planned(i.e A cooling tower that supplies water to cool down a power generating asset has broken down, Â which has. Â now forced the power generating asset offline as the temperature can no longer be Â regulatedÂ properly)
Opportunistic - This outage arises. Â when. Â an enerft proveder wishes to be proactive with the maintenance of their asset and believes that it can complete maintenance on its plant withing a 48 hour window. If it takes longer than this, the outage is considered a PLANNED outage as it was planned in advance. Â and will take longer than 48 hours
Planned - This outage arises when an energy provider reports to the AEMR that an energy generating asset needs to be. Â taken offline for routine or planned maintenece activities to ensure the. Â reliability of the asset in the future
ONLY FORCED IS PENALIZED due to if enough energy providers enter the forced outage state and the demand for energy is greater than the amount of energy that can be supplied, stress will be put on the energy system. This will then threaten the reliability of theÂ network which is what the AEMR wishes to avoid

Project will Examine how much energy was lost due to the outage types and the duration of these outage events in order for AEMR to put more focus on minimizing the outage events and duration to increase the reliability of the energy market

Tools used in project include the following: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodel

Techniques used in project include the following: Filtering dataframe/columns, checking missing values, checking positive/negative correlations, visualizing comparison with box plots/line graphs/bar graphs, potential outliers, for loop, multivariate regression model, analysis of coefficents, regressive predictions
