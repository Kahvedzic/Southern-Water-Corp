# Southern Water Corp Using Python (Jupyter Notebook)

# Project Background

Souther Water Corp. is an Israeli water desalination company that sells fresh water for
three customer segments: Residential, Public, and Private. Since the demand for
agricultural and residential use is rising, Southern Water Corp. needed to maximize the
availability of its three desalination plants. This has resulted in increased revenue for the
calendar year. While the increase in revenue is fantastic, Southern Water Corp does not
want an unsustainable rise in costs.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

* Indicate whether the variable PUMP FAILURE (1 or 0) are failing (1) or behaving normal (0).
* Potential outliers when PUMP FAILURE = 1 (Failure) or PUMP FAILURE = 0 (Normal Behaviour).
* Iterate through dataframe by plotting every variable individually to analyze which variables were most significant to pump failure (1 or 0) for a more streamlined analysis.
* Pump failures over a rolling time period to analyze how the variables move with respect to pump failure.
* Analyze variable correlations against PUMP FAILURE (1 or 0).
* Create OLS regression model that models the PUMP FAILURE(Y-Variable) against all independaent variables.
* Analysis of coefficients to better understand the variables displaying the largest rate of change with respect to PUMP FAILURE.
* Lastly, validate predictions using our regressive model.
